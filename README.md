# GeneticTSP

This project face up the parallel implementation of a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem using genetic algorithm. TSP is a routing problem defined as follows: "given a set of cities (x,y) find the shortest path that allows the salesman to visit all the cities once and return to the starting point". Genetic algorithm instead is a method for solving optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution.
Three different Implementation are provided:
<ul>
<li>Sequential Implementation, used as a baseline for comparing performances
<li>Parallel Implementation using C++ thread
<li>Parallel Implementation using FastFlow
</ul>
